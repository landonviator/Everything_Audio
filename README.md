# Everything_Audio
The Everything Audio Blog is a front-end project I made when learning the Materialize framework. It is the admin page of a blog devoted to audio engineers who can post and comment on audio topics.

The main page shows a section devoted to giving the admin data about how many monthly visitors they've had, how many blog posts they have, how many comments they've had, and how many users are subscribed to their blog. The main page also uses Canvas.js to create a chart showing the daily visitor traffic on their blog. There's a "latest comments" section which shows the admin their most recent comments, a section that shows their most recent posts, and a to-do function for the admin to leave notes for themself.

This was my first project using materialize with sass and my main focus was getting a pleasing color scheme together, putting together an admin page that was well organized intuitive, and utilizing other JavaScript libraries such as Canvas.js.
